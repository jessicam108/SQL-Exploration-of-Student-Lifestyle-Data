# SQL-Exploration-of-Student-Lifestyle-Data

Using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle on university students and how their time is partitioned as well as their GPA and self-determined stress levels, I conducted an analysis to answer questions on how sleep affected their GPA, whether there is a negative correlation between "work" hour vs "self-care" hours, and how time spent on physical activity was related to stress levels.

In addition, I grouped study hours into bins to compare hours spent studying to GPA.
